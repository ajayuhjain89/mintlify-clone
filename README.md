---

## Project Overview

This is a desktop-first clone of the **mintlify.com** landing page. I built this for the **Web Dev Cohort 2026** using only pure HTML and CSS to practice layout accuracy and visual hierarchy without using any frameworks.

## Recreated Sections

I have successfully implemented all **11 required sections**:

- **Header & Hero:** Navbar and the main intro with the large product image
- **Feature Blocks:** Three sections with alternating text and images
- **Grids & Cards:** Feature card grid, testimonials, and use case cards
- **Company Info:** Trusted logos, changelog list, and the team section
- **Footer:** Final call-to-action and the full site footer

## Technical Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS:** No Tailwind or JavaScript were used
- **Typography:** Used the **Inter** font from Google Fonts to match the original look
- **Layout:** Used **Flexbox** for simple alignments and **CSS Grid** for the complex card sections
